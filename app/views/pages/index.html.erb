Dromaeosauroides was a theropod dinosaur that lived around 140 million years ago during the Early Cretaceous, making it one of the oldest known dromaeosaurs. In 2000 and 2008, two fossilised teeth from this genus (cast pictured) were discovered in the Jydegaard Formation in the Robbedale valley, on the island of Bornholm, Denmark, in the Baltic Sea. It is the first dinosaur reported from Denmark. After these discoveries, remains and tracks of more dinosaurs were found in several formations on Bornholm. Coprolites containing fish remains found in the Jydegaard Formation may belong to Dromaeosauroides. The teeth are curved and finely serrated. Based on a comparison with other dromaeosaur teeth, the genus is estimated to have been 2 to 3 metres (7 to 10 ft) in length, with a weight of about 40 kilograms (88 lb), a hide covered with feathers, and a large sickle claw on both feet. It lived in a coastal lagoon environment with sauropods, as evidenced by a possible titanosaur tooth.
